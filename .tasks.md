Features to add
- [x] Add a README... no matter how basic
- [x] Deleting all tasks loads them all into the clipboard
- [x] Yank all tasks in the list ('yA')
- [x] Number keybinds jump straight to that number list
- [x] 'Q' quites without saving, probably with a confirmation?
- [ ] Reordering lists? Might have to change what H/L do

Potential features
- [x] Support for multiple lines? idk how to do this one from a ui perspective
- [ ] Better help menu?
- [ ] Some kind of footer on the .tasks.md file that links to this projects github page?
- [ ] Maybe 'n' should add the task underneath the current one...? Sounds complicated
- [ ] Someway of not saving changes? Maybe 'Q' with a confirmation prompt?
- [ ] G keybind? for jumping to the bottom of a list? gg for going to the top?
- [ ] Reading from a file passed as an argument instead of the default if it is present

Bugs
- [ ] Look into why canceling an operation causes the program to freeze
- [ ] figure out how to fix the typing_line function so that escape sequances arent counted
- [ ] Fix backspace not working when the cursor is moved
