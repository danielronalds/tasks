Features to add
- [ ] Reordering lists? Might have to change what H/L do

Potential features
- [ ] Some kind of footer on the .tasks.md file that links to this projects github page?
- [ ] Reading from a file passed as an argument instead of the default if it is present

Potential changes
- [ ] Maybe 'n' should add the task underneath the current one...? Sounds complicated
- [ ] Better help menu?
- [ ] Refactor the code base, maybe organise a little better?

Bugs
- [x] Fix the backspace in the typing_line function so that it does not crash the program when the string is empty
- [x] Figure out how to fix the typing_line function so that escape sequances arent counted
- [ ] Look into why canceling an operation causes the program to freeze? Esc key causes the pause
